 ![](images/vulnerability.png)

5. Select the **VA1143** finding to view the detailed description.

 ![](images/vulnerability1.png)


### Task 8: Configure Dynamic Data Masking: 
 
In this exercise, you will enable Dynamic Data Masking (DDM). DDM limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. This feature helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. It’s a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

1. Now navigating to SQL Database **Clinic** to add a mask.
2. Go to **Dynamic Data Masking** under **Security** blade, then select **+Add Mask**.

2. Use following configurations to create a mask rule:
* Schema: **dbo**
* Table: select **Patients** from dropdown
* Column: **SSN (char)** from dropdown

![](images/mask1.png)

3. Select **Add**.
4. Add a mask again by selecting **+Add Mask**.
5.  Use following configurations:
* Table: select **Visits** from dropdown
* Column: **PatientID (int)** from dropdown
* Masking field format: **Number (random number range)**
* Enter random value for **To** and **For**.

![](images/mask2.png)

6. Then select **Add**. 
Your mask rules are ready.

### Task 9: Verify data how does it look by using App
